What is mOS for HPC
===================

mOS for HPC is an operating systems research project at Intel, targeting
extreme scale HPC systems deploying converged workflows for modeling /
simulation, data analytics, and AI. It aims to deliver a high performance
computing environment with the scalability, low noise, and repeatability
expected of lightweight kernels (LWK), while maintaining overall Linux
compatibility that HPC plus AI / ML applications need.

mOS for HPC remains under development at this time. These materials are being
made available to interested parties to explore, to test drive, and to provide
feedback through the mailing list. It is not intended to be used for business
critical uses. The ability to compile, install, and boot a Linux kernel is
required to get mOS up and running. A good understanding of what an OS does and
how it interacts with the underlying hardware is needed to configure the LWK
partition and get the most out of it. Support is limited by the development
team's ability to respond through the mailing list.

New for v1.0
============

- Based on SLES15 SP4 version of Linux 5.14.21 from github.com/openSUSE
- GPU ressource management support
        - Dependency on Intel OneAPI Level Zero APIs
	- New yod options to control GPU reservations
- Bug fixes
