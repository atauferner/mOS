                                mOS - views
                                -----------

Description:
------------
mOS view is the view of some of the procfs and sysfs files for a process in mOS.
On mOS the hardware resources (CPU, Memory, NUMA domains) are partitioned betwe-
-en Linux and LWK. A process running on mOS installed machine can see the system
resources in procfs and sysfs in following three valid views,

View
----
linux - Only resources designated for Linux kernel are visible. This view is not
	a valid view for an LWK process and can be set only for Linux processes.

lwk   - Only resources designated for LWK are visible.

all   - Union of linux and lwk, i.e. resources designated to both Linux and LWK
        are visible.

Summary of valid Configurations:

        Task    View
        ----    ----
        Linux   linux
        Linux   lwk
        Linux   all

        LWK     lwk
        LWK     all

How to set the mOS view for a process?

  a) A process can choose any one of the views by writing the valid view name
       linux or lwk or all to its, /proc/self/mos_view

  b) A process A can change view of process B (belonging to same user/group) by
     writing to, /proc/<pid B>/mos_view

  c) At the time of fork the mOS view of the parent process is inherited by the
     child process. Subsequently child can override its view via a) or b)

  d) The mOS view 'all' will be the default view for a process. The mOS view of
     init process with pid 1 will be set to 'all'

  e) The mOS view of the child process of an LWK process will be set to the def-
     -ault view irrespective of the current mOS view of the LWK process.

mOS view for CPUs:
------------------

Based on the set mOS view the process interprets procfs and sysfs files related
to CPU resources.

Read/Write to following files interpret mOS views,

Procfs:
-------
    /proc/stat
        Filters displaying stats of CPUs but not other stats like accumulated
        CPU stat, process stats, irq stats etc. Since htop refers to this file
        for displaying the CPU load meters this file has been considered.

    /proc/cpuinfo

Sysfs:
------
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/present
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/online
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/offline
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<N>/online
    /sys/devices/system/node/node<N>/cpumap
    /sys/devices/system/node/node<N>/cpulist
    /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.cpus
    /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.effective_cpus
    /sys/devices/pci*/*/local_cpulist
    /sys/devices/pci*/*/local_cpus

Tools used for testing:
    lscpu, htop, numactl, yod

Notes:
------
  - Reading cpuset.cpus and cpuset.effective_cpus by Linux processes does not
    interpret mOS views. Only LWK processes interpret mOS views for these.

    For an LWK process in,
      all view: all LWK CPUs are added to the existing list of Linux CPUs.
      lwk view: only LWK CPUs are shown.

  - Ideally it is not absolute necessity for /sys/devices/system/cpu/present to
    interpret mOS views, but the standard tool like lscpu considers present
    mask instead of online mask for computing the available no.of CPUs/cores. In
    order to enable such tools it was considered to interpret the above file.

  - mOS view interpretation is only applicable to userspace and does not hold
    within the kernel.

Tool - mosview:
---------------
mosview is the userspace tool that can be used to,

  - Run a user command in the specified mOS view
      ex: To run lscpu in mOS view 'all'
          mosview -s all lscpu

  - Set mOS view of a running process
      ex: To set mOS view of a running process to 'lwk' view,
          mosview -s lwk -p <pid>

  - Print the mOS view of a running process
      ex: mosview -p <pid>
